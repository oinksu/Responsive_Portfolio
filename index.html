          <p>Born in Santiago, Chile, lived within the Midwest for about 20 years. My background is in automated manufacturing processes. I currently work as a quality assurance analyst for a local software company. I worked independently as an HVAC technician for 5 years successfully without any formal training. I have acquired many skills over the years, not just out of personal interest, but the times demand people to do so. As the job market evolves, my ultimate goal is to provide people with new skills via attainable resources. I enjoy playing around with various musical instruments and have been know to draw or paint a few things. I just generally like to know and experiment. For more information on my work experience you can check out my resume <a href= "Resources\FCAR_resume_2019_Jul_Gen.pdf">here.</a></p>
